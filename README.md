## v2 Roadmap

Would be an UI tool that will implement all features from v1.

## What is stax-like git workflow?

It is a way to reduce the burden of creating commits, branches, and PRs, so it doesn't consume much
of your time. As a result, you can start creating more PRs with smaller changes in them and have
them reviewed easier and faster at the same time catching more bugs.

## Commands

To see full list of commands, run:

```
stax help
```

Here is the list of commands currently available:

### stax commit

Creates branch, commits current changes with the same name as a branch, and pushes.

![stax commit diagram](https://github.com/TarasMazepa/stax/assets/6552358/013c5848-1697-49b2-a1b2-17f17eeea9cb)

```
stax commit "two-in-one-commit-name-and-branch-name"
```

Result:

```
commit 8161c952fbed66672aff80cd3d1233589cdc3c0c (HEAD -> two-in-one-commit-name-and-branch-name, origin/two-in-one-commit-name-and-branch-name)
Author: Taras Mazepa <taras.mazepa@example.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 8 14:58:04 2023 -0700

    two-in-one-commit-name-and-branch-name

```

You can see that a branch with `two-in-one-commit-name-and-branch-name` name was created as well as
a commit with the same name `two-in-one-commit-name-and-branch-name`.

#### -a flag

Adds all the files to staging area

#### --pr flag

Redirects you to a create PR page

### stax amend

Amends to the current commit and force pushes branch

![stax amend diagram](https://github.com/TarasMazepa/stax/assets/6552358/c3025256-2e4f-4c8f-95c1-095ab9b8b514)

```
stax amend
```

### stax delete-gone-branches

Deletes local branches with gone remotes. Useful when you are using `stax-commit` which pushes all
the branches. So once they are merged and deleted from the remote you can clean up local branches.

![stax delete-gone-branches diagram](https://github.com/TarasMazepa/stax/assets/6552358/55be3cf5-3667-4568-a8b0-785f623ec680)

### stax pull

Switching to main branch, pull all the changes, deleting gone branches and switching to original
branch.

### stax log

Outputs tree structure of your branches.

```
> stax log
  x Updates-stax-log-example-in-readme
  o Adds-stax-log-example-to-readme
o-â”˜ origin/main, origin/HEAD, main
| o Promotes-version-command-to-be-not-hidden-command
o-â”˜
```
