# Stax

Stax is a tool that will help you a bit with day-to-day stax-like git workflow.

Main purpose is to make it easier to creat smaller PRs. And reduce amount of energy other people need to review them.

Currently, the tool is still in the early incubation period.

## What is stax-like git workflow?

It is a way to reduce the burden of creating commits, branches, and PRs, so it doesn't consume much of your time. As a result, you can start creating more PRs with smaller changes in them and have them reviewed easier and faster at the same time catching more bugs.
