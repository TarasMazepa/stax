 * stax log - will survive repository with big amounts of merge commits

0.10.17
 * stax log - will now detect cycles in the tree if they involve remote/HEAD

0.10.16
 * stax log - if repository has many "original" commits (the ones without parent) stax will make sure to select one which has access to the remote head, as stax would ensure that each node will only have one parent

0.10.15
 * stax log - now only requests 100k latest commits from git log to build tree, which improves performance on repositories with larger amount of commits

0.10.14
 * stax log - fixes a bug when new logic causes stack overflow for larger repositories 

0.10.13
 * stax get - fix case when stax get would not search for remote refs specifically, which will result in it not being able to "get" branches
 * stax log - making sure that merge commit resolution would not get rid of remote head tree

0.10.12
 * stax log - and other commands that rely on it would now handle merge commits better, also fixed couple of stack overflow cases

0.10.11
 * --loud -> --verbose - renaming global flag to conform with other commandline tools, adds -v shorthand
 * stax pull - will not attempt to switch back to a branch that was just deleted
 * stax log, stax move - now will see node tree in the same way, so stax move commands like stax move up 1, will select child commit with index 1, and not a random one based on stax move tree that wasn't sorted with the same method as stax log
 
0.10.10
 * stax delete -> stax delete-stale - renaming delete to delete-stale
 * --silent -> --quiet - renaming global flag to conform with other commandline tools, adds -q shorthand

0.10.9
 * stax log - fix case when repo has more then one commit without parents and stax chooses the wrong one to build tree for

 * stax amend - gets short name 'a'

 * stax help - now accepts optional argument to show help only for one command
